# **_NutriVision: an Integrated Food Recognition, Calorie Estimation, and Recipe Recommendation System_**

This study introduces an advanced deep learning system tailored for food recognition, offering users the option of obtaining calorie estimations or recipe recommendations based on input images. Positioned at the intersection of health informatics and computer vision, the project endeavors to elevate nutritional management capabilities. With a specific emphasis on reinforcing robust deep learning models, particularly leveraging the ResNet50 architecture renowned for its adeptness in image classification, the project meticulously trains and validates using the extensive "Food-101" dataset, ensuring a comprehensive spectrum of food item recognition.

Upon identifying food items from input images, the system seamlessly transitions to a phase of nutritional scrutiny, engaging external APIs( *CaloriesNinja* for calorie estimation and *Edamam*'s "Recipe_Search" for recipe suggestions) for meticulous calorie estimation and recipe retrieval. This integration facilitates detailed insights into recognized food items, encompassing their caloric content and constituent ingredients. The amalgamation of expansive nutritional data with ResNet50's proficient image recognition heralds a noteworthy advancement in dietary tracking methodologies, completely addressing persisting concerns regarding precision, variety, and user accessibility in prevailing nutritional management tools.
