# **_NutriVision: an Integrated Food Recognition, Calorie Estimation, and Recipe Recommendation System_**

This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically the ResNet50 architecture, to build an advanced food recognition system. Trained on the Food101 dataset, the system can accurately recognize a variety of food items from images and provide nutritional insights through calorie estimation and personalized recipe recommendations.

Key features:

Food Recognition: Classifies food items from images using ResNet50.

Calorie Estimation: Integrates with CaloriesNinja API for precise calorie calculations.

Recipe Recommendations: Uses Edamam API to fetch personalized recipes based on recognized food items.

Key Achievements:
High accuracy in food recognition with ResNet50.

Successful integration with external APIs for calorie estimation and recipe retrieval.

Challenges addressed include dataset diversity, model optimization, and precise API query structuring.
